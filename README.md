# etch-a-sketch
A 16x16 grid of square divs that change color when moused over. 
Allows the user to reset the grid, change the grid density, and change the colors.

Guidelines:
Dynamically create a 16x16 grid of divs with js/jquery.
Set up hover effect so that the color changes when the mouse passes over the square.
Add a button to the grid that clears it, and then regenerates the grid with a user specified size.
(optional) Have the mouse hover change a square to a random color, and each subsequent pass make it 10% darker until it becomes black.
